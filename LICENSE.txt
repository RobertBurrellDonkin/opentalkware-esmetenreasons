What are the licensing terms, and how do they affect the content of a slide show 
   done in S5?

   First, whatever license S5 has or did have, it will only ever apply to the 
technology, not the content. You can prepare a confidential presentation where 
the content is not only copyrighted and patented, but Top Secret as well. S5's 
license will not affect it.

   As of version 1.1, the technology itself has been explicitly released into the
Public Domain, so there are no restrictions whatsoever on its use or reuse (nor
can there ever be). S5 v1.0 was published under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license, which still holds for that version of the 
software. The change was made because I found out CC licenses aren't appropriate
for software only after 1.0 came out. Oops.
